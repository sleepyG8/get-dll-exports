# get-dll-exports
This program takes in a single parameter, a dll on disk, and retrieves all the function names for it. Try it on ntdll.dll, it will return all nt function names. This is useful for RE and exploring Windows internals

saves all dll function names to a file named for example "ntdll.dll.txt"
